This version of FindCuda is copied from the original SVN version (repository version 1203) from https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/svn/findcuda/trunk
The authors are Abe Stephens / James Bigler (see https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/gf/project/findcuda/scmsvn/?action=browse&path=%2F*checkout*%2Ftrunk%2FFindCuda.html).

We copied this version to our CMakeModules-folder because the FindCuda-script which comes with a new CMake installation seems to have issues with some MSVC environments. This seems to be resolved in the above SVN version.
